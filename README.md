The Random Question Game is an exciting high risk game that will truly challenge you on random facts that you truly will never need to know. (Unless you don't want to accidentally make mustard gas)
first struggle. I cannot seem to make the items in div stay where they are. Will work on that.
second struggle, still havent figured out the div alignment problem(DAP) but now my JS.firls don't seem to be working... for any page!
Boxes still aren't in order but have learned that terminal doesn't work but functions are still...functioning. 
Figured out box issue with flex box flex wrap wrap. Terminal still isn't working but functions still working. Made the base for pages.
Working on each question design and actual question. Currently working with past instructor to help solve terminal issue. Internet is no help.
Getting the buttons to do what they need to do with functions, also created a wrong answer page and a congrats page.
FINALLY FIGURED OUT TERMINAL PROBLEM. I had my JS.files in an assets folder. In the terminal I had to cd into the assets folder to access my js.files.
Making it so you can not advance by just clicking the next question button but actually have to get the question right. Used a function to make the "click here for..." appear if clicked on correct answer only.
added your score at the top.
